Predicting UFC FIghts

## Project Intent

This project will be used to showcase different approaches in machine learning/deep-learning as well as statistical analysis. EDA will be conducted but from the collected dataset(from Kaggle), a preliminary model will be used and will serve as a base line for all model to proceed.


## Preliminary Analysis
Using the pre-processes data, Artificail Neural Network (ANN) was used to create a model to predict a UFC fight. An accuracy of 90% 
+ was produced in the preliminary model. Grid Search will be conducted to indentify the mosst feasible model.

### Improving ANN
As of this writing (7 Oct 19), Gridsearch is in script but causing errors. Debugging is on going to improve the model. I might consider going back to the raw data and conduct data cleaning and EDA and see if I would arrive at the same dataset or prediction.
