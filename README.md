Predicting UFC FIghts

## Project Intent

This project will be used to showcase different approaches in machine learning/deep-learning as well as statistical analysis. EDA will be conducted but from the collected dataset(from Kaggle), a preliminary model will be used and will serve as a base line for all model to proceed.


## Preliminary Analysis
Using the pre-processes data, Artificail Neural Network (ANN) was used to create a model to predict a UFC fight.
